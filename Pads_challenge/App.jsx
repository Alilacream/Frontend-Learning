     * clicked. Map over the previous pads array, and if the current
     * item you're iterating over has the same id as the `id` passed
     * to this function, then return a new object with the `on` value
     * set to the opposite of what it was before.
     * Otherwise (if the ids don't match), just return the previous
     * item as it was, unchanged.
     * DONE :>
